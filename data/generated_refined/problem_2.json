  "qwen_cot": "To solve the problem of implementing a function `sum_product(nums: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]` that returns the **sum** and **product** of all integers in the list, we need to carefully consider the mathematical definitions and edge cases.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Problem Understanding\n\nWe are given a list of integers and are required to compute two values:\n- The **sum** of all the integers in the list.\n- The **product** of all the integers in the list.\n\nThe function should return these two values as a tuple: `(sum, product)`.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Key Considerations\n\n#### 1. **Sum of an empty list**\n- The sum of an empty list is **0** by definition. This is the additive identity.\n\n#### 2. **Product of an empty list**\n- The product of an empty list is **1** by convention in mathematics and many programming languages. This is the multiplicative identity. However, note that in Python's `math.prod()` function, an empty list raises a `ValueError`. But since we are implementing this manually, we will follow the standard mathematical convention.\n\n#### 3. **Zero in the list**\n- If the list contains a zero, the product will be **zero**, regardless of the other elements. This is correct behavior.\n\n#### 4. **Negative numbers**\n- The function should handle negative numbers correctly. For example, `[-1, 2]` should return `(1, -2)`.\n\n#### 5. **Single-element list**\n- If the list has only one element, both the sum and product should be equal to that element. For example, `[5]` should return `(5, 5)`.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Steps to Implement the Function\n\n1. **Initialize the sum and product:**\n   - `total_sum = 0` (additive identity)\n   - `total_product = 1` (multiplicative identity)\n\n2. **Iterate over each number in the list:**\n   - For each number, add it to `total_sum`.\n   - Multiply it with `total_product`.\n\n3. **Return the tuple of the computed sum and product.**\n\nThis approach ensures that:\n- If the list is empty, the function correctly returns `(0, 1)`.\n- If the list contains only one element, the function returns `(num, num)`.\n- If the list contains zero, the product becomes zero, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Example Test Cases\n\nLet's test the function with a few examples to confirm correctness:\n\n#### Example 1:\n```python\nnums = [1, 2, 3]\nsum_product(nums)  # Expected: (6, 6)\n```\n\n#### Example 2:\n```python\nnums = [0, 1, 2]\nsum_product(nums)  # Expected: (3, 0)\n```\n\n#### Example 3:\n```python\nnums = []\nsum_product(nums)  # Expected: (0, 1)\n```\n\n#### Example 4:\n```python\nnums = [5]\nsum_product(nums)  # Expected: (5, 5)\n```\n\n#### Example 5:\n```python\nnums = [-1, 2]\nsum_product(nums)  # Expected: (1, -2)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n#### Mistake 1: Initialize product as `0`\n- If `total_product = 0` is used instead of `1`, then even for a non-empty list, the product will always be `0` (since 0 * anything = 0).\n- **Correct:** Start with `1`.\n\n#### Mistake 2: Not handling empty lists\n- If the function doesn't handle empty lists, it may return incorrect results or raise an error.\n- **Correct:** The loop will not execute, and the default values of `0` and `1` will be returned.\n\n#### Mistake 3: Assuming product is `0` for empty lists\n- This is incorrect. The product of an empty list is `1`, not `0`.\n- **Correct:** Return `(0, 1)` for empty lists.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Implementation\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef sum_product(nums: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    total_sum = 0\n    total_product = 1\n    for num in nums:\n        total_sum += num\n        total_product *= num\n    return (total_sum, total_product)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Summary\n\nThis implementation correctly computes the sum and product of all integers in the list, including handling edge cases like empty lists and zero values. It adheres to the mathematical definitions of sum and product, ensuring robustness and correctness across all valid inputs.",

The problem statement does not explicitly mention handling an empty list, but the code assumes the product of an empty list is 1, which is mathematically correct but may not align with specific user expectations.\n2. The code does not handle cases where the list contains non-integer values, but the function signature specifies `List[int]`, so this is not required.\n3. The code does not include error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., `None` instead of a list), but the function signature assumes a valid list of integers."
