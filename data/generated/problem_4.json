  "gpt_cot": "To implement the `truncate_number` function, we need to extract the decimal part of a given positive floating-point number. Let's break down the steps involved in achieving this:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Input and Output\n- **Input**: A positive floating-point number (e.g., `3.5`).\n- **Output**: The decimal part of the number (e.g., for `3.5`, the output should be `0.5`).\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Number\nTo get the decimal part of a number:\n1. We can separate the integer part from the decimal part.\n2. The integer part can be obtained using the `int()` function, which truncates the decimal part.\n3. The decimal part can be calculated by subtracting the integer part from the original number.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Logic\n1. Use `int(number)` to get the integer part.\n2. Subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.\n\n### Step 4: Write the Code\nNow that we have a clear understanding of how to extract the decimal part, we can write the function.\n\n```python\ndef truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Get the integer part\n    integer_part = int(number)\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the decimal part\n    decimal_part = number - integer_part\n    \n    return decimal_part\n```\n\n### Step 5: Test the Function\nWe can now test the function using the provided example and additional cases to ensure it works correctly.\n\n```python\n# Testing the function\nprint(truncate_number(3.5))  # Expected output: 0.5\nprint(truncate_number(2.75))  # Expected output: 0.75\nprint(truncate_number(5.0))   # Expected output: 0.0\nprint(truncate_number(0.99))  # Expected output: 0.99\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly extracts the decimal part of a positive floating-point number.",

  "qwen_cot": "To solve the problem of extracting the **decimal part** of a **positive floating point number**, we need to understand how floating point numbers are structured. A positive float can be decomposed into two parts:\n\n- **Integer part**: The largest integer less than or equal to the number (i.e., the part before the decimal point).\n- **Decimal part**: The remainder after subtracting the integer part from the original number (i.e., the part after the decimal point).\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n1. **Input**: A positive floating point number, e.g., `3.5`.\n2. **Goal**: Return the decimal part, which is `0.5` in this case.\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Extract the integer part of the number.\n   - Subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - In Python, the `int()` function truncates the decimal part of a float, effectively giving the integer part.\n   - Subtracting `int(number)` from `number` gives the decimal part.\n   - Alternatively, using `number % 1` also gives the decimal part, as the modulo operation with 1 returns the remainder after division by 1, which is the decimal part.\n\nBoth methods are valid, but using `number % 1` is more concise and avoids any confusion with integer truncation.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases Considered\n\n- **Exactly integer value**: For example, `4.0` \u2192 decimal part is `0.0`.\n- **Numbers very close to the next integer**: Due to floating point precision, such as `3.9999999999999999`, which may be stored as `4.0` in Python. In such cases, the decimal part would be `0.0`, which is correct.\n- **Numbers with non-terminating decimal expansions**: For example, `0.1` (which is not exactly representable in binary floating point). The function will return the actual decimal part as represented by the float, which is acceptable given the problem constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Final Implementation\n\n```python\ndef truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\"\n    return number % 1\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- `number % 1` computes the remainder when the number is divided by 1.\n- For any positive float, this remainder is the **decimal part** of the number.\n- The result is returned as a float, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\nThis solution is concise, efficient, and handles all valid positive floating point numbers as described in the problem.",
