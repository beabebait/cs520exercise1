  "gpt_cot": "To implement the `mean_absolute_deviation` function, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Mean**: First, we need to compute the mean (average) of the input list of numbers. The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of the numbers.\n\n2. **Calculate Absolute Deviations**: For each number in the list, we will calculate the absolute deviation from the mean. This is done by subtracting the mean from each number and taking the absolute value of the result.\n\n3. **Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation**: Finally, we will calculate the mean of these absolute deviations. This is done by summing all the absolute deviations and dividing by the count of the numbers.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: The function will return the calculated Mean Absolute Deviation.\n\nNow, let's implement the function based on these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0.0  # Handle the case of an empty list\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the mean\n    mean_value = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the absolute deviations\n    absolute_deviations = [abs(x - mean_value) for x in numbers]\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the mean of the absolute deviations\n    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(numbers)\n\n    # Step 4: Return the result\n    return mad\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- We first check if the input list `numbers` is empty. If it is, we return `0.0` to avoid division by zero.\n- We calculate the mean of the numbers.\n- We then create a list of absolute deviations using a list comprehension.\n- Finally, we compute the mean of these absolute deviations and return the result.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the steps we outlined.",

  "qwen_cot": "To compute the **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)** of a list of numbers, we follow a well-defined statistical procedure. The MAD is a measure of variability that represents the average distance of each data point from the mean of the dataset.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Calculate the Mean**  \n   The mean of the list is computed by summing all the elements and dividing by the number of elements:\n   $$\n   \\text{mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\n   $$\n   where $ x_i $ are the elements of the list and $ n $ is the number of elements.\n\n2. **Compute Absolute Deviations**  \n   For each number in the list, subtract the mean and take the absolute value of the result:\n   $$\n   \\text{absolute deviation} = |x_i - \\text{mean}|\n   $$\n\n3. **Average the Absolute Deviations**  \n   Finally, sum all the absolute deviations and divide by the number of elements to get the MAD:\n   $$\n   \\text{MAD} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - \\text{mean}|}{n}\n   $$\n\n---\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nHere is the implementation of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function using Python's built-in functions and list comprehensions for clarity and efficiency:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.\n    \n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean:\n    MAD = average |x - x_mean|\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers: A list of floating-point numbers.\n        \n    Returns:\n        The mean absolute deviation as a float.\n    \"\"\"\n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    return sum(abs(num - mean) for num in numbers) / len(numbers)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nFor the input list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`:\n\n- **Mean** = $ \\frac{1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0}{4} = 2.5 $\n- **Absolute Deviations** = $ |1.0 - 2.5| = 1.5 $, $ |2.0 - 2.5| = 0.5 $, $ |3.0 - 2.5| = 0.5 $, $ |4.0 - 2.5| = 1.5 $\n- **Sum of Deviations** = $ 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 4.0 $\n- **MAD** = $ \\frac{4.0}{4} = 1.0 $\n\nThis matches the expected output from the docstring.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Empty List**: The function assumes the input list is non-empty. If an empty list is passed, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n- **Single Element**: If the list contains only one number, the mean is that number, and the absolute deviation is zero. Hence, the MAD will be zero.\n- **All Elements Equal**: If all elements are the same, the absolute deviation for each is zero, and the MAD will be zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final Notes\n\nThis implementation is concise, readable, and leverages Python's efficient list comprehensions to compute the required values in a single line after calculating the mean. It adheres to the mathematical definition of MAD and works correctly for any non-empty list of floating-point numbers.",
